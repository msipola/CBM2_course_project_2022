We use diabetes data from [here](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~boos/var.select/diabetes.html) for modeling. From scikit-learn description:

"Ten baseline variables, age, sex, body mass index, average blood
pressure, and six blood serum measurements were obtained for each of n =
442 diabetes patients, as well as the response of interest, a
quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline."
